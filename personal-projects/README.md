### [A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/)
Begin of 2016, I started using `{ggplot2}` to visualize my research data. Starting by try'n'error, the resource I came always back to was a blog entry called Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross. To learn and especially understand the complexity of `{ggplot2}` with all it's opportunities, I decided to go through this tutorial step-by-step and - since it was not updated since quite a while - I directly started modifying the codes and adding additional code snippets, chart types and resources. The full tutorial is [hosted on my blog](www.cedricscherer.netlify.com). Here is a sneak peak of the variety of charts and plot twists contained in this resource:

### [The Evolution of a ggplot](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/)
A (planned) series of blog posts with the aim to provide a step-by-step tutorial explaining how my visualization have evolved from a typical basic ggplot.
The first (and until now unfortunately only) episode is a tutorial for [my contribution](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots/2019_19) to the [#TidyTuesday challenge of week 2019/19](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-07) and received much attention by the R community on Twitter (for example [here](https://twitter.com/CedScherer/status/1129453356756492293) and [here](https://twitter.com/robinson_es/status/1158792970042269696)).

### A Personalized [404 Error Page](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/this/should/not/work)
To make the page a bit more me, I've designed a unique error page that honors the main content and tool on my blog - `{ggplot2}`.

### Berlin Weather Data (work in progress)
Recently, I've started to play around with Berlin weather data (mainly temperatures and precipitation) provided by the [DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/klarchivtagmonat.html) with daily resolution dating back to 1886. Here are some of the plots I've created for a multi-panel data visualization and info graphic. I've also used this data to create animated bar chart races as a demonstration of `{ggplot2}` capabilities ([read more about why](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/09/17/bar-chart-race-temperatures-berlin/)).

### Baby Girl Names (work in progress)
An analysis of girl names that I've started when my daughter was born and I recently picked up again to finally turn it into a blog post.
