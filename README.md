## DataViz Portfolio
This is a collection of my favorite data visualizations created for different purposes.
Most of them were created using the R package `{ggplot2}`.

### [Challenge Contributions](https://github.com/Z3tt/DataViz-Portfolio/tree/master/challenges)

I participate in various data visualization challenges, mostly [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) but also [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) and the [SWD challenge](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/swdchallenge). All contributions were created in `{ggplot2}` without any post-editing.

### [Scientific Projects](https://github.com/Z3tt/DataViz-Portfolio/tree/master/scientific-projects)

For my research, I draft many explorative and publication-ready figures with `{ggplot2}` as well as designed schemes and overviews.

### [Personal Projects](https://github.com/Z3tt/DataViz-Portfolio/tree/master/personal-projects)

During my spare time, I create visualizations for different purposes such as short and long tutorials that I've published on [my blog](www.cedricscherer.netlify.com) and illustrations for teaching purposes. Recently, I also started personal data visualization projects to broaden my portfolio.
